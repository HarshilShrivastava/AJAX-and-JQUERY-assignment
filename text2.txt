<h2>Fred puts in remarkable fighting display vs Brighton & Hove Albion</h2>
<h4>Score: (MAN UTD) 2-1 (Brighton)</h4>
<p>Manchester United star Fred was one of the few players who could hold his head high after the comeback victory vs Brighton. The Brazilian midfielder was chosen to partner Paul Pogba and it’s safe to say he made a real case for his position. Fred was tasked with being the one who was deeper of the pair, doing the dirty work in order to release the talented Frenchman further forward. Pogba was thrown right into the starting XI on his return and although he wasn’t at his best, he managed to grab an assist nonetheless.</p>
